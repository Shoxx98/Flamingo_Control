# Flamingo_Control (Py2Flamingo)

This repository provides control software for Flamingo systems. It is designed for use with [Flamingo systems](https://huiskenlab.com/resources/).
This is a fork of [Talley Lambert and Michael S. Nelson's Flamingo_Control](https://github.com/uw-loci/Flamingo_Control).

# Goal of this repository
I am trying to rip out all the Qt stuff to achieve compatibility with a flask frontend that is currently being worked on at the [Deutsches Optisches Museum](https://deutsches-optisches-museum.de/)
